# Playtest
- 3.3 Xuesong: make the sight more narrow. give more control of the rotation.
- 3.3 Sunil: tutorial disappear too fast. not clear what to do. guards are not obvious.
- 3.4 Abhishek: add jump while running. everytime you get a light, scene turns bright for limited time and then fade into dark. respawn light. player dies without seeing a guard coming.
# Playtest after the first iteration
- 3.4 Emre: score becomes zero after character being seen, feel frustrated.
- 3.4 Sunil: introduction part is too long. develop the story inside of the game, give clues with writing on walls which can only be seen when they look around with the mouse.
